# My Portfolio: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love CSS

My first go at building my own portfolio. The design is inspired by a mockup provided to me through my course curriculum. This site was a true test of my CSS skills. 

I really enjoyed playing around with the colors, but not so much the layout. My main struggles were finding out how flexboxes behave, and how margin and padding play into how the elements behave when trying to make the layout responsive. 


## Color Choices

The source of the color palette came from a really cool site called: [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/). I generated the coastal color palette based on the splash image, which I obtained from [this site](https://picsum.photos/). The other color palette, which was dubbed Sunset by the creator, also caught my eye, and it inspired me to do something different that I have not tried before -- create **two** stylesheets. At first, this caused me a lot of tedious work since my layout was embedded into the original and the new stylesheet, forcing me to make the same changes to the layout twice. After spending way too much time doing this, a light bulb turned on, make the layout a separate stylesheet. This realization made my life easier during my journey building my portfolio, and I intend on implementing this idea into future projects that will have different styles based on the page the user is on. **Hint:** Click Hello, and my name in the header of the site.

## The Layout

I am not particularly fond of the layout, but I am proud of how I was able to make it completely responsive. The layout was inspired by a mockup provided to me. I plan on a complete redo of the colors, and design of my portfolio. I plan on keeping this repo and its page live to demonstrate my ability to be mindful of all types of devices.
